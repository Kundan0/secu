Algorithm
1. split the uploaded video into video of 40 frames each
1. for each video in videos:

2.  tracks=yolotrack(track)->[[frame_idx,id,(left,top,right,bottom),],[],[]]
    depths=calculatedepth(depth)
    tracks_=[]
    for each frame found in first frame:
        for each vehicle_id:
            []=forecast(id)->find in how many frames ,id have been identified
            if vehicle have been located less than 70% time(28/40):
                #fill the holes with previous approach used in test.py
                tracks.append(track)
    for each track:
        find avg_depths=[]
        speed=model(track,avg_depths)
